# Liae - Discord Bot

A continously developing bot I am working on to learn how to create discord bots using `discord.py`. Currently only has 4 commands.

## Commands

`!` Will be used to annotate the commands that require Admin Privilege to execute (in the code the admin role is annotated with `*`)

- Hello
    - Says `Hello` back to the user
- Copycat
    - Sends back a message that the user typed in
- `!` Add role with colour
    - Creates a simple role with name and colour (using HEX [without #]) to create it and tells the user it's been created. The default colour if not specified is white.
- `!` Delete role by name
    - Allows the user to delete the role by name
