# Liae - Discord Bot

A continously developing bot I am working on to learn how to create discord bots using `discord.py`.

## Features

`!` Will be used to annotate the commands that require Admin Privilege to execute (in the code the admin role is annotated with `*`)

- Hello
    - Says `Hello` back to the user
- Copycat
    - Sends back a message that the user typed in
- `!` Add role with colour
    - Creates a simple role with name and colour (using HEX [without #]) to create it and tells the user it's been created. The default colour if not specified is white.
- `!` Delete role by name
    - Allows the user to delete the role by name
- `!` Edit role
    - Allows the user to edit the role by inputting the current role name, the edited role name and a new HEX colour (optional)
- Create a user voice channel
    - When user enters the `Create Room` voice channel, it will create a new voice channel named `{user}'s Room`, moving the user to it and deleting the voice after the user leaves.
